# Phishield â€“ Real-Time Phishing Protection (Browser Extension)

As part of the Lab Rats team at TUMO Labs, we developed PhiShield, a browser extension designed to protect usersâ€”especially vulnerable populations like children and the elderlyâ€”from phishing attacks.

Phishield works in real-time to analyze links and classify them using a color-coded system:<br/>
ðŸ”´ High Risk (Blocked) â€“ Prevents access to malicious links.<br/>
ðŸŸ¡ Potential Risk (Warning) â€“ Alerts users but allows them to proceed with caution.<br/>
âœ… Safe (No Underline) â€“ Verified as secure.<br/>

Our solution integrates multiple verification layers, including VirusTotal API, EasyDMARC API, and AI-based detection, to ensure maximum protection.

We built PhiShield to secure every click and make the internet safer for everyone.
